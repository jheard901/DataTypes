#Currently having a problem with error LNK2019 "unresolved external symbol". I know I have
seen this issue tons of times in coding in the past, but I forgot what causes it to pop up.

$Solve this issue and code should compile; the issue is probably related to the driver attempting
to use some unsecured logic. I need to do a walk through of the code in its driver to confirm that
it is logically correct/accurate.

$(9-11-16)This issue was caused because of including a defined class template in the header of another
class template. I solved it by including both class templates in a separate driver file. I got rid of
any specialization code that I had before in list. I am thinking for this list that instead of making
it use generic types, it should only support using the Obj class which can be filled with generic types.
From there, we would add in specialization to Obj when it uses specific types such as string, other
class objects, and etc...
UPDATE @ 11:30AM: I used info from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1723537/template-specialization-of-a-single-method-from-a-templated-class
to get specializations to work. I believe they are partial specializations - I still don't fully
understand how it works, but... it works!
